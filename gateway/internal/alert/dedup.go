package alert

// dedup.go — the Redis SET NX EX 300 fingerprint dedup gate for the
// Phase 7 alerting goroutine (OBS-06). One incident = one notification:
// before the alerter fans an alert out to Chatwoot / ClickUp / Brevo, it
// asks dedupShouldSend whether this fingerprint has already been alerted
// inside the 5-minute window.
//
// This file owns the dedup *policy* (the SET NX call, the TTL, the
// fail-open vs fail-closed decision); redisx/alert.go owns the *key
// layout* (the gw:alert:dedup: namespace + the AlertDedupKey builder).
// The split mirrors how shed.go / emerg.go keep their key builders in
// redisx and their FSM logic in their own packages.
//
// # Fail-open vs fail-closed (07-RESEARCH.md Pattern 2)
//
// When Redis itself errors, dedupShouldSend cannot know whether this is
// a duplicate — so it falls back to a severity-dependent default:
//
//   - critical → fail-OPEN  (return true, send anyway): a Redis hiccup
//     must never silence a GPU-down page. A duplicate page is an
//     annoyance; a missed one is an outage nobody noticed.
//   - warning / info → fail-CLOSED (return false, suppress): for the
//     lower tiers, alert fatigue is the larger risk — a Redis outage
//     that also flapped a warning should not flood the on-call inbox.
//
// This is threat T-07-19's documented, accepted tradeoff.
